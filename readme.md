## About
This repo contains the source code of ReviewScope - a minimal and modular end to end sentiment analysis dashboard for Playstore app reviews.

### Features

#### üßë‚Äçüíª User-Level
- üì¶ Scrapes real user reviews (configurable count) from the Google Play Store.  
  *(Apple App Store support is stubbed ‚Äî contributions welcome!)*
- üß† Supports sentiment analysis using both `VADER` and HuggingFace transformers.  
  Each review is classified as `POSITIVE`, `NEGATIVE`, or `NEUTRAL` with an associated score (0‚Äì1).
- üìä Visualizes rating distributions
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Displays top **themes** and **keywords** as interactive word clouds

#### Developer-level
- ‚öôÔ∏è **End-to-end** pipeline ‚Äî from ingestion to visualization ‚Äî fully automated with Docker (Works out of the box!)
- üîå Configuration-driven design (via `.env` files)
- üß© Microservice architecture ‚Äî components can be distributed across physical/virtual machines or replaced independently
- üîÑ Plug-and-play modularity ‚Äî easily swap models, queues, or databases
- üì¶ Fully containerized with clean `Dockerfile`(s) and a central `docker-compose.yml`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

The system is composed of six loosely coupled microservices:


### 1. üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard Frontend  
A minimal dashboard built with `Vite + React`.  
Runs on `localhost:3000` when containerized.  

Comes with a `Dockerfile` for easy build and deployment.  
It‚Äôs recommended to use the [Minimalistic run setup](#minimalistic-run-setup) to launch all services together.


### 2. üõ†Ô∏è Dashboard Backend  
A lightweight REST API built with `Go` using the `gin-gonic` framework.  
Includes a `DAL` layer to support database switching.  

Exposes APIs to the frontend and is the **only service exposed externally**.

### 3. üîç Scraper  
`Python3` based microservice that wraps the `google-play-scraper` library.  
Fully configurable: scrape by `country`, `language`, review `count`, and `sort order`.  

> To increase review volume for sentiment analysis, increase the `review_count` parameter in the config.

A stub for Apple App Store scraping is included for future extension.


### 4. üß† NLP Engine  
A pluggable Python module for processing review sentiment.  
Supports:
- `VADER` (lightweight, rule-based)
- `HuggingFace` models (transformer-based)

Future model support can be added via the existing interface.

---

### 5. üì¨ Job Queue  
Acts as the coordinator for the entire pipeline.  
Backed by MongoDB but wrapped with a `FastAPI` interface for flexibility.  

Decoupled via a `DAL` layer ‚Äî making it easy to switch to `SQLite`, a managed queue, or another database.

#### Why a job queue?
- Enables each microservice to operate independently and asynchronously
- Adds resilience to failure ‚Äî if one service goes down or restarts, others continue
- Allows services like the Scraper or NLP Engine to run on custom schedules (e.g., every hour, once a day)
- Supports future horizontal scaling ‚Äî run multiple NLP workers or scrapers in parallel
- Makes the system observable and extensible by centralizing job status, retries, and metadata



### 6. üóÉÔ∏è MongoDB  
Stores all reviews, sentiment data, metadata, and job states.  
Used across all services.

No ORM is used in the entire repo ‚Äî keeping things lightweight and transparent.  
Database interactions are abstracted via DALs for easy migration.

> MongoDB is bundled with the project via Docker Compose.  
> If you have your own Mongo setup, configure connection strings in the `.env` files of each service.


# üß† System Architecture ‚Äî ReviewScope

ReviewScope is a distributed, modular system that scrapes app reviews from the Play Store, performs sentiment analysis, and presents the results on a clean dashboard.

This section explains **how the system works** end to end, and how each component fits into the larger picture.

---

## üìä At a Glance

The system supports two core flows:

### 1. **Cached View (Pre-scraped apps)**

- Users can select from previously processed apps.
- The backend fetches cached reviews, sentiments, and metadata (themes/keywords) from MongoDB.
- The UI updates instantly without needing to re-scrape anything.

> ‚úÖ Fast and ideal for common/popular apps.

---

### 2. **On-Demand Flow (New app requests)**

Users can enter any valid Play Store package name (e.g., `com.spotify.music`). The system kicks off a fresh data pipeline.

---

## üîÅ End-to-End Job Lifecycle

Here's how a **new job flows through the system**:

### ‚úÖ Step 1: App Validation

- The frontend sends the app ID to the **backend**.
- The backend validates the package ID with the Play Store.
- If valid, it creates a job in the **Job Queue**, with:```
    {status: ‚Äúqueued‚Äù, stage: ‚Äúscraper‚Äù}```
---

### üßΩ Step 2: Scraping

- The **Scraper** (a Python microservice) polls the queue every 10s.
- It picks the oldest job with:```{status: ‚Äúqueued‚Äù, stage: ‚Äúscraper‚Äù}```
- Marks it as `processing`, scrapes reviews using `google-play-scraper`.
- Saves raw reviews to MongoDB.
- Updates the job:
```{status: ‚Äúqueued‚Äù, stage: ‚Äúnlp‚Äù}```

---

### üß† Step 3: Sentiment Analysis

- The **NLP Engine** (another Python service) also polls the queue.
- It picks jobs at:
```{status: ‚Äúqueued‚Äù, stage: ‚Äúnlp‚Äù}```
- Parses reviews using **VADER** or **HuggingFace** models.
- Enriches reviews with:
  - Sentiment score (0‚Äì1)
  - Sentiment label (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
  - Keywords, themes
- Stores processed data in MongoDB.
- Updates the job:```status: ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù, stage: ‚Äúdone‚Äù```

---

### üéØ Step 4: Dashboard Display

- The **backend** reads the now-completed data from MongoDB.
- The **frontend** visualizes:
- Sentiment trends over time
- Rating distribution
- Top themes and keywords
- Recent reviews

---

## üìà Visual Workflow

![Job Flow](jobqueue/img.png)

> Each stage is isolated ‚Äî enabling resilience, scalability, and asynchronous execution.

The workflow status can be seen in the UI by clicking on `view app submission` button.

---

## üß© Why This Architecture?

This setup provides:

- ‚úÖ **Loose coupling** between modules
- ‚úÖ **Distributed** different modules can run on different machines
- ‚úÖ **Fault tolerance** ‚Äî failures don‚Äôt break the whole system
- ‚úÖ **Scalability** ‚Äî run scraper/NLP in parallel or on separate machines
- ‚úÖ **Extensibility** ‚Äî swap models, data sources, or queues without rewriting everything
- ‚úÖ **Observability** ‚Äî track job state throughout the pipeline

## üõ†Ô∏è Components Involved

| Component     | Language    / Framework    | Role                           |
|---------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Frontend      | React                      | Dashboard UI                   |
| Backend       | Go (gin-gonic)             | API layer for data + job queue |
| Job Queue     | FastAPI                    | Orchestrator (status tracker)  |
| Scraper       | Python                     | Fetches raw reviews            |
| NLP Engine    | NLTK \| Huggingface models | Performs sentiment analysis   |
| MongoDB       | N/A                        | Stores raw + enriched reviews  |

---

This design reflects a **production-style microservice system** with clear boundaries, high flexibility, and a pipeline that can be run continuously or on-demand.
